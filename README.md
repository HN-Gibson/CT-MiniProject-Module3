Presenting a Program for a Contact Management System

**Welcome to my Contact Management System.**

**First of all, thank you for using my program!**

**Goal of this Program:** 
To provide you with a easy way to create a collection of contacts to be exported to a file for later use.

**Important Notes:**
    - Your collection starts off empty.
    - Leaving inputs blank (i.e. Hitting enter without typing an input) may result in having to re-enter information.
    - When you export your contacts, it will overwrite the 'my_contacts.txt' file included with this program. As such please make sure to create a back-up copy of any contacts you would like to keep before exporting a new collection.
    - At various points in the program, you will be met with the option to continue in a particular feature of return to main menu. Simply type 'q' to return to the main menu in these instances. Don't worry, you willl be reminded of this in the program should you forget.
    - Finally, phone number and email validation is used throughout the program. Please keep this in mind when entering either. Phone number expect the format "XXX-XXX-XXXX" while emails expect to follow a similar format to "example@example.com."

**Now, to the important how to of my program:**

When you start the program, you will be greeted by a menu. Let this be your guide to navigating the different features.

Important things to remember about the menu:
    - Do not leave inputs blank! If you do, you may have to re-enter info.
    - Use corresponding menu numbers as input to access different features (i.e., Do not try typing out the whole option.)

**Menu Options (a.k.a. Features)**

1. Add a new contact:
    - This is the start of your experience. You can't do much with contacts that don't exist...
    - This option will provide you with opportunity to add contacts to your collection.
    - Please make sure to follow the prompts and enter information appropriately. There is validation in place for phone numbers and emails, so if these values are input in an unrecognized format, you will be returned to the intial prompt of this feature. 
    - It will allow you to add more than one contact without returning to the menu. 
    - Each time you add a contact, you will recieve a confirmation of the information being added.
    - Type 'q' to exit to menu when prompted to enter a new phone number.

2. Edit an existing contact:
    -This is where you will have the free range to select a contact to edit by first entering the associated phone number and then selecting the detail you would like to edit.
    **Remember: If you edit the number and then want to edit other information, use the new number to acces that contact.**
    - There is validation in place for phone numbers and emails.
    - Keep in mind, if you edit notes, it will overwrite the existing notes.
    - You will recieve a confirmation message each time a contact is updated.
    - Type 'q' to exit to menu when prompted to enter a phone number you would like to edit.

3. Delete a contact: 
    - This is the feature that allows removal of contacts as a whole.
    - There is validation in place for phone numbers and emails.
    - When you enter a number in this feature, you will remove the whole contact including, name, email, and notes.
    - Type 'q' to exit to menu when prompted to enter a phone number you would like to delete.

4. Search for a contact:
    - This feature allows you to search for a contacts using the associated phone number.
    - There is validation in place for phone numbers and emails.
    - It will print the information for each contact you search and ask if you would like to search another contact.
    - Type 'q' to exit to menu when prompted to enter a phone number you would like to search.

5. Display all contacts:
    - Quite simply, this feature displays all currently held contacts in you collection.

6. Export contacts to a text file
    - Exports all contacts to a new text file in the same directory as the program.
    - It will create or overwrite the associated file when exporting, so remember to create back-ups of any contacts in a separate file if using this program repeatedly.

7. Import contact from a text file (WIP)
    - This feature is a work in progress, I hope to return to it in the future.
